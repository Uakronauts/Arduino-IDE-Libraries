# ArduinoIDE-Libraries
Akronauts list of necessary libraries to be able to run any Arduino IDE-based code from the organization. (See instructions for installation)

# Instructions for Installation:

1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and link your GitHub account.
2. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
3. Clone this repository to your system, but when you're choosing a location, go to Documents/Arduino. Then, clone, which will create a folder with the name "Arduino-IDE-Libraries" containing all of this repo's contents.
4. Rename the cloned folder to "libraries." (This will probably ask you to replace your current libraries folder, this is okay)
5. Go back to GitHub Desktop, where it will alert you that it has lost the cloned repository folder. Click "Locate" and select your libraries folder that you renamed in step 4.
6. Congrats, now your libraries folder will automatically update with whatever libraries we add to new projects!
